# All-Pairs-Shortest Paths Problem

This C++ code was a task to implement the algorithms from the _All-Pairs Shortest-Paths_ chapter, from the book _Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition_ by Thomas H. Cormen, as a extension of the implementation of weighed and unweighed graphs done during the course _Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms_. 
The added algorithms include a standard All-Pairs Shortest-Paths algorithm and its optimization, the Floyd-Warshall and Johnson algorithms, as well as Transitive Closure and finding the shortest negative weight cycle.
